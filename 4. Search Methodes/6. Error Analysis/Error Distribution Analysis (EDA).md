# Error Distribution Analysis (EDA)

Error Distribution Analysis (EDA) is a systematic approach to identifying and addressing weaknesses in text embeddings by analyzing the distribution of errors produced during model evaluation. This method provides insights into the reliability, biases, and robustness of text embeddings in various tasks.

## Steps to Perform Error Distribution Analysis in Text Embeddings

### 1. **Define the Context and Dataset**

- Select a downstream task (e.g., sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or text classification) where the embeddings will be evaluated.
- Prepare a dataset with ground truth labels for the task.

### 2. **Train and Evaluate the Model**

- Apply the text embedding model (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT, GloVe) to transform text data into vector representations.
- Train and evaluate a classifier or other model using the embeddings as input.
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

### 3. **Error Collection and Identification**

- Compare model predictions with ground truth labels to identify errors.
- Record instances where the model fails, such as incorrect classifications or low similarity scores for semantically similar text pairs.
- Collect the text samples (e.g., sentences or words) corresponding to these errors.

### 4. **Error Categorization and Clustering**

- Categorize errors by type (e.g., syntactic, semantic, or domain-specific errors).
- Assess how different factors (e.g., rare words, ambiguous terms, or sentence structure) contribute to errors.
- Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means or DBSCAN) on the erroneous text embeddings to identify patterns.
- Alternatively, employ dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to visualize the error clusters.

### 5. **Analyze Clusters for Patterns**

- Examine clusters to determine whether errors arise due to:
  - **Polysemy:** Words with multiple meanings are misrepresented.
  - **Synonymy:** Similar words are mapped to dissimilar embeddings.
  - **Rare Words:** Embeddings poorly represent low-frequency words in the training corpus.
  - **Domain-Specific Terms:** General embeddings fail for technical jargon.
- Example: In sentiment analysis, embeddings might confuse sarcastic sentences or idiomatic expressions.

### 6. **Statistical Distribution Analysis**

- Analyze the distribution of errors using statistical metrics such as mean squared error, cosine similarity deviations, or clustering techniques.
- Compare cluster metrics (e.g., intra-cluster variance) to assess how well embeddings separate classes.

### 7. **Weakness Identification**

- Pinpoint embedding-specific weaknesses, such as underperformance on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, lack of robustness to noise, or domain-specific biases.
- Measure cosine similarity or other distance metrics between erroneous samples and their respective correct labels.

### 8. **Visualization**

- Use visualization tools like t-SNE or PCA to map the embedding space and highlight regions with higher error rates.

### 9. **Remediation and Refinement**

- Refine embeddings through techniques such as fine-tuning on specific domains, adding new data, or integrating advanced methods like adversarial training.
- Augment training data to address rare or domain-specific terms.
- Apply contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT or RoBERTa) if static embeddings fail.
- After refining the embeddings, retrain the model and evaluate its performance to ensure the weaknesses have been mitigated.
