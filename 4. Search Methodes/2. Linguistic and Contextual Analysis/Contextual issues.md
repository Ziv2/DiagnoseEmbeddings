Finding weaknesses in text embeddings using contextual issues involves identifying limitations in how embeddings handle semantics, polysemy, bias, domain adaptation, and other context-related challenges. Below is an explanation of how this is done, supported by references to academic papers and resources:

### Methodology for Identifying Weaknesses

1. **Bias Detection in Contextual Embeddings**:
   
   - Embedding models often perpetuate biases present in training data. Bias can be measured by analyzing outputs on tasks sensitive to stereotypes, such as word association tests or semantic similarity measures.
   - Example: A study reviewed 19 embedding models, showing that higher-performing models are more prone to capturing biases but are also better at incorporating contextual adjustments [(Uriot, 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/on-debiasing-text-embeddings-through-context-injection-uriot/1d85f65787f75fca9643a9c126e9b9b5/?utm_source=chatgpt).

2. **Domain-Specific Contextualization**:
   
   - Weaknesses arise when embeddings trained on general corpora perform poorly in domain-specific tasks. Domain-adaptive fine-tuning, which adapts embeddings to new domains (e.g., Early Modern English or Twitter), reveals gaps in their initial generalization capacity [(Han & Eisenstein, 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/unsupervised-domain-adaptation-of-contextualized-han-eisenstein/59612732e09759d6a2e338f47172237e/?utm_source=chatgpt).

3. **Polysemy and Contextual Understanding**:
   
   - Embedding models often struggle with polysemy (multiple meanings of a word). Contextualized embeddings like BERT and ELMo mitigate this issue to an extent but may fail when context is ambiguous or sparse.
   - Example: BERT-based embeddings were found to reduce polysemy-related errors by adapting embeddings to context but faced challenges with nuanced disambiguation [(Yunianto et al., 2020)](https://consensus.app/papers/domainspecific-contextualized-embedding-a-systematic-yunianto-permanasari/cfcdf9b4837b5ab69ea9c44b9aabb279/?utm_source=chatgpt).

4. **Evaluation via Context Injection**:
   
   - Context injection tests embeddings' robustness by introducing explicit contextual information to resolve ambiguities or biases.
   - Example: Techniques like dynamically adjusting embeddings during retrieval tasks have demonstrated improvements in handling biases and contextual mismatches [(Uriot, 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/on-debiasing-text-embeddings-through-context-injection-uriot/1d85f65787f75fca9643a9c126e9b9b5/?utm_source=chatgpt).

5. **Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluations**:
   
   - Intrinsic evaluation involves tasks like word similarity or analogy, while extrinsic evaluation assesses embeddings on downstream tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.
   - Example: Combining clustering techniques with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) revealed weaknesses in short-text classifications due to sparse contexts [(Wang et al., 2016)](https://consensus.app/papers/semantic-expansion-using-word-embedding-clustering-and-wang-xu/d74a7447d59c56e38c6dcae47614421f/?utm_source=chatgpt).

### Conclusion

Analyzing weaknesses in embeddings through contextual issues involves evaluating biases, domain-specificity, polysemy, and adaptability via tailored experiments. Context injection and domain adaptation can reveal and mitigate these weaknesses.
