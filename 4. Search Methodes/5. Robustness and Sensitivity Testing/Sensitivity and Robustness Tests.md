Sensitivity and robustness tests, including adversarial and perturbation analyses, are crucial for evaluating and improving the reliability of text embeddings. Robust embeddings maintain semantic consistency across diverse inputs, ensuring higher utility and fairness in NLP tasks.

With **Sensitivity and robustness tests**, researchers can evaluate how embedding models respond to small perturbations, adversarial inputs, or changes in text.

### Sensitivity and Robustness Tests for Text Embeddings:

1. **Perturbation Analysis**:
   
   - Small perturbations (e.g., misspellings, synonym replacements, or reordering of words) are introduced into input texts.
   - The change in embedding vectors is analyzed to assess model sensitivity. Robust models should maintain similar embeddings for semantically similar texts despite perturbations.
   - Example: In biomedical NLP, stress tests with adversarial examples, like spelling errors or synonyms, revealed significant weaknesses in embeddings [(Araujo et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/stress-test-evaluation-of-biomedical-word-embeddings-araujo-carvallo/ca7c49729a2d5be0b2b17d0651b1fd7c/?utm_source=chatgpt).

2. **Adversarial Testing**:
   
   - Adversarial attacks, where the input is manipulated to mislead the embedding model, are applied. For instance, adding noise or malicious phrases to text.
   - The robustness of embeddings is evaluated based on their stability and performance under these conditions.
   - Example: The WildNLP framework systematically tests models for corruption robustness (e.g., keyboard errors, misspellings) [(Rychalska et al., 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/models-in-the-wild-on-corruption-robustness-of-neural-nlp-rychalska-basaj/369f0547d4805ee499f46bdb7f267132/?utm_source=chatgpt).

3. **Sensitivity Indices**:
   
   - Techniques like Sobol sensitivity analysis are used to quantify the impact of changes in hyperparameters or input features on embedding quality.
   - This helps identify which features or hyperparameters contribute most to variations in embeddings [(Lloyd et al., 2022)](https://consensus.app/papers/assessing-the-effects-of-hyperparameters-on-knowledge-lloyd-liu/b48138315a8b5185b20d1467d231e887/?utm_source=chatgpt).

4. **Robustness Benchmarks**:
   
   - Benchmarks like “Latent Jailbreak” test the balance between robustness and sensitivity by embedding malicious instructions in regular tasks, assessing the model's ability to handle both safely and robustly [(Qiu et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/latent-jailbreak-a-benchmark-for-evaluating-text-safety-qiu-zhang/88ab966e2bc451fb931be788f1236b1b/?utm_source=chatgpt).

5. **Embedding Geometry Analysis**:
   
   - Researchers analyze the geometry of embedding spaces, such as investigating distances or subspace structures, to understand sensitivity to irrelevant variations or domain-specific biases [(Kuznetsov et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/robust-aigenerated-text-detection-by-restricted-kuznetsov-tulchinskii/a9520e393876587fa60418da6ff2a0fb/?utm_source=chatgpt).
