Textual embeddings have become a cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems, transforming raw text into dense numerical representations that enable machines to understand and generate human language. Models such as word2vec, GloVe, fastText, BERT, and GPT encapsulate semantic and syntactic relationships, powering applications like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. Despite their widespread success, identifying weaknesses or low-performance areas in these embeddings is essential to ensure fairness, robustness, and efficiency, particularly as their applications expand across domains.

#### The Importance of Analyzing Weaknesses in Embeddings

Embedding weaknesses can have far-reaching consequences. Biases within embeddings, for instance, may reinforce discriminatory practices in sensitive applications such as recruitment or loan approvals. Seminal works like Bolukbasi et al.'s (2016) ["Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf) have highlighted these issues and provided initial strategies for mitigating them. Similarly, advancements like contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) have addressed challenges such as handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, but systematic evaluations reveal persistent limitations in robustness and adaptability to unseen contexts.

#### Scientific Breakthroughs Enabled by Embeddings

Textual embeddings have catalyzed breakthroughs in diverse fields. For example, in computational biology, embeddings have been used to encode protein sequences for modeling protein folding, as demonstrated by tools like AlphaFold ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold)). In the social sciences, embeddings have been employed to trace semantic shifts in language, enabling researchers to visualize how concepts like "freedom" have evolved over centuries, offering new insights into cultural and historical phenomena.

#### Scope of This Review

This literature review surveys methodologies for identifying and addressing weaknesses in textual embeddings, with a focus on both their theoretical and practical aspects. The review covers the following areas:

1. **Clustering**: Methods to analyze how embeddings group semantically similar data and uncover anomalies.
2. **Fairness and Bias Assessment**: Techniques to measure and mitigate biases in embeddings, ensuring equitable outcomes.
3. **Linguistic and Contextual Analysis**: Evaluation of embeddings across linguistic contexts, including multilingual and OOV scenarios.
4. **Dimensionality and Topological Analysis**: Understanding the structure of embedding spaces through techniques like manifold learning and latent space visualization.
5. **Robustness and Sensitivity Testing**: Assessments of embeddings' resilience to adversarial perturbations, temporal drift, and task transfers.
6. **Real-Time Applications**: Investigation of how embedding weaknesses manifest in real-time systems.

The review also features **comparative tables** summarizing methods across key criteria, such as Speed (for real-time use) Computational Resources and Impact Rank.
